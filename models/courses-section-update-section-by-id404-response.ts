ClickFunnels API

# Introduction

The ClickFunnels v2 API lets you:

- import data from other apps and sources into ClickFunnels and export data that you need somewhere else
- extend the ClickFunnels platform to your own needs and embed it in your own applications
- act on behalf of other ClickFunnels users via OAuth to offer extended services to other fellow ClickFunnels entrepreneurs

We are starting with exposing a given set of resources but the goal is to converge in terms of
functionality with what the actual app is offering and also offering functionality on top.

# Authentication

Making your first request is easiest with a Bearer token:

```shell
$ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/teams' \\
--header 'Authorization: Bearer AVJrj0ZMJ-xoraUk1xxVM6UuL9KXmsWmnJvvSosUO6X'
[{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"My Team\", # ... more output...}]
```

How to get your API key step by step:

https://developers.myclickfunnels.com/docs/getting-started

# Rate limiting

The rate limit is currently set per IP address.

The actual rate limit and the approach on how this is handled is subject to change in future
releases. Please let us know if you have special request limit needs.

# Pagination and Ordering

In order to paginate through a large list response, you can use our cursor-based pagination using
the `id` field of a given object in the list.

There is a limit of 20 objects per list response ordered ascending by ID. So, you can get to items
after the last one in the list, by taking the last item's ID and submitting it in a list request
as the value of an `after` URL parameter. For example:

```shell
# The first 20 contacts are returned without any pagination nor ordering params:
$ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"id\": 1, \"email_address\": \"first@contact.com\" ...}, {\"id\": 4, ...} ... {\"id\": 55, \"email_address\": \"last@contact.com\", ...}]

$ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?after=55' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"id\": 56, ...}] # There is one more record after ID 55.
```

The `after` param always acts as if you are \"turning the next page\". So if you order in a descending
order, you will also use `after` to get to the next records:

```shell
$ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?sort_order=desc' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"id\": 56, ...},  {\"id\": 55, ...}, {\"id\": 4, ...}] # All contacts in descending order.

$ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?sort_order=desc&after=4' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"id\": 1, ...}] # There is one more contact on the next page after ID 55.
```

You can also use the `Pagination-Next` header to get the last ID value directly:

```http request
# Example header.
Pagination-Next: 55
```

And you can use the `Link` header to get the next page directly without needing to calculate it
yourself:

```http request
# Example header.
Link: <https://localteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?after=55>; rel=\"next\"
```

# Filtering

**Current filters**

If filtering is available for a specific endpoint, 'filter' will be listed as one of the options in the query parameters section of the Request area. Attributes by which you can filter will be listed as well.

**How it works**

There is a filter mechanism that adheres to some simple conventions. The filters provided on
list endpoints, like `filter[email_address]` and `filter[id]` on the `Contacts` list endpoint, need
to be \"simple\" and \"fast\". These filters are supposed to be easy to use and allow you to filter by
one or more concrete values.

Here's an example of how you could use the filter to find a contact with a certain email address:

```shell
$ curl -g 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?filter[email_address]=you@cf.com' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"email_address\": \"you@cf.com\",...}]
```

You can also filter by multiple values:

```shell
$ curl -g 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?filter[email_address]=you@cf.com,u2@cf.com' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"email_address\": \"you@cf.com\",...}, {\"email_address\": \"u2@cf.com\",...}]
```

You can also filter by multiple attributes. Similar to filters that you might be familiar with when
using GitHub (e.g.: filtering PRs by closed and assignee), those filters are `AND` filters, which
give you the intersection of multiple records:

```shell
# If you@cf.com comes with an ID of 1, you will only see this record for this API call:
$ curl -g 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?filter[email_address]=you@cf.com,u2@cf.com&filter[id]=1' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'
[{\"email_address\": \"you@cf.com\",...}] 
# u2@cf.com is not included because it has a different ID that is not included in the filter.
```

> Please let us know your use case if you need more filter or complex search capabilities, we are 
> actively improving these areas: https://feedback.myclickfunnels.com/feature-requests?category=api

# Webhooks

ClickFunnels webhooks allow you to react to many events in the ClickFunnels app on your own server, 
Zapier and other similar tools.

You need to configure one or more endpoints within the ClickFunnels API by using the [Webhooks::Outgoing::Endpoints](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Webhooks::Outgoing::Endpoint) 
endpoint with the `event_type_ids` that you want to listen to (see below for all types).

Once configured, you will receive POST requrests from us to the configured endpoint URL with the
[Webhooks::Outgoing::Event](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Webhooks::Outgoing::Event#operation/getWebhooksOutgoingEvents) 
payload, that will contain the subject payload in the `data` property. Like here for the
`contact.identified` webhook in V2 version:

```json
{
  \"id\": null,
  \"public_id\": \"YVIOwX\",
  \"workspace_id\": 32,
  \"uuid\": \"94856650751bb2c141fc38436fd699cb\",
  \"event_type_id\": \"contact.identified\",
  \"subject_id\": 100,
  \"subject_type\": \"Contact\",
  \"data\": {
    \"id\": 12,
    \"public_id\": \"fdPJAZ\",
    \"workspace_id\": 32,
    \"anonymous\": null,
    \"email_address\": \"joe.doe@example.com\",
    \"first_name\": \"Joe\",
    \"last_name\": \"Doe\",
    \"phone_number\": \"1-241-822-5555\",
    \"time_zone\": \"Pacific Time (US & Canada)\",
    \"uuid\": \"26281ba2-7d3b-524d-8ea3-b01ff8414120\",
    \"unsubscribed_at\": null,
    \"last_notification_email_sent_at\": null,
    \"fb_url\": \"https://www.facebook.com/example\",
    \"twitter_url\": \"https://twitter.com/example\",
    \"instagram_url\": \"https://instagram.com/example\",
    \"linkedin_url\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/example\",
    \"website_url\": \"https://example.com\",
    \"created_at\": \"2023-12-31T18:57:40.871Z\",
    \"updated_at\": \"2023-12-31T18:57:40.872Z\",
    \"tags\": [
      {
        \"id\": 20,
        \"public_id\": \"bRkQrc\",
        \"name\": \"Example Tag\",
        \"color\": \"#59b0a8\"
      }
    ]
  },
  \"created_at\": \"2023-12-31T18:57:41.872Z\"
}
```

The content of the `data` property will vary depending on the event type that you are receiving.

Event types are structured like this: `subject.action`. So, for a `contact.identified` webhook, your
`data` payload will contain data that you can source from [the contact response schema/example in the
documentation](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Contact#operation/getContacts). Similarly, for
webhooks like `order.created` and `one-time-order.identified`, you will find the documentation in
[the Order resource description](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Order#operation/getOrders).
